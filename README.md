Use Upgrade headers:-
Upgrade header can be used to upgrade an already established client/server connection to a different protocol (over the same transport protocol). 
For example, it can be used by a client to upgrade a connection from HTTP 1.1 to HTTP 2.0, or an HTTP or HTTPS connection into a WebSocket.
Websockets :-
WebSocket API makes it possible to open a two-way interactive communication session between the user's browser and a server.
